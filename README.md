* Saving / Restoring position
* Various debug draws such as hitboxes, events, collision etc
* Item Spawn / Mass item spawn
* Character cheats such as No Death/No Damage
* Target Controls
* Pop out resistances / poise window that you can have on top of the game  (for the target)
* Stats and New Game change
* No Clip
* Warps
* Unlock All Bonfires
* Skipping the gank phase of Ivory King (With ice)
* Skipping end credits
* 100% drop rate
* Auto set ng+7 / spawn weapon at start of new game
* Force Save
* Baby jump fix


Usage:
Unzip the download and run the exe, it does not matter if you open the app before the game or after.
Make sure the three files and the folder are in the same place when you use the tool.
